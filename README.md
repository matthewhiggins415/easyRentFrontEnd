# Welcome to easyRent Property Manager: 
This project was inspired by a recent move from Oahu to Denver. In that move I needed to find an apartment and thought it was interesting that each apartment building typically has a website listing the available apartments. This easyRent project is a property manager application where property owners can add their available properties, add tenants to those properties, and add tasks to those properties should there be any outstanding to-do items. 

### Setup to run frontend: 
1. clone ``` git clone git@github.com:matthewhiggins415/easyRentFrontEnd.git ```
2. ``` npm install ```
3. ``` npm start ```  
4. [easyRent Backend](https://github.com/matthewhiggins415/tenant-organizer-fullstack) should you need it. 
   
### Link to Deployed Site:

### Technologies Used: 
- React 
- styled-components
- axios
- react-router-dom

### Planning: 
I first outlined the features I wanted to implement, then I created wireframes reflecting those features for each view.

### Future Goals: 
1. Improve UI/UX - I want to implement framer-motion for page transitions and micro animations. There is a lot of room for improving the CSS. 
2. Adding images to create property form. 
3. The sidebar bugs me üêû, I think it would be better being a hamburger react-icon and when clicked shows the full sidebar, animating out with framer-motion. Then closing again when menu link selected.
